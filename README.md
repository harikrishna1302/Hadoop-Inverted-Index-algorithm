# Hadoop-Inverted-Index-algorithm
This project is to find the number of times each word occurs in the given input data and to learn how the MapReduce works using Eclipse. MapReduce is a massive parallel processing technique for processing data which is distributed on a commodity cluster. MapReduce is a method for distributing a task across multiple nodes. Each node is processing data, stored on local to those nodes whenever possible.
## Requirements:
Hadoop, JDK1.8 or JDK1.7, Eclipse, Maven and input data.
